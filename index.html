            Hi, my name is <strong>Ethan Mankins</strong>. I am a 4th year
            student in computer engineering at Cal Poly (SLO). Since childhood,
            I have had the desire to become an engineer; from changing the
            lightbulbs in the kitchen to taking apart and reassembling various
            electronics. Throughout high school, I fully realized my passion for
            computer engineering through at-home and extracurricular projects. I
            spend much of my free time tinkering with RasperyPis and Arduinos to
            make small home robots. I am currently finishing up my Bachelor of
            Science in Computer Engineering as well as exploring my passion for
            robotics and virtual reality. I like to spend my freetime at Grover
            Beach listing to music or cooking at a fire.
