        Hi, my name is <strong>Ethan Mankins</strong>. I am from Spokane,
        Washington. I'm a 4th year in computer engineering. Fun fact about me is
        that I still live on campus as a <em>4th year...</em> My hobbies are
        cooking, going to the beach (and often cooking), and playing video
        games. I usually play competitive FPS like Apex or Destiny 2.
